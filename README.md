# coding-agent-proxy

A cross-platform Rust loopback reverse proxy for Codex, Claude Code, ChatGPT account APIs and
OpenAI documentation MCP. It selects an outbound proxy by matching account or
API Key credentials. HTTP/SSE data is passed through without model or protocol conversion.

## Configuration

Build with Rust 1.85+ and Cargo on macOS, Linux, or Windows:

```sh
cargo build --locked --release
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `Copy-Item` and `coding-agent-proxy.exe`.
The executable has no Python runtime dependency; Python 3.10+ is needed only
for the optional service manager and integration tests.

The top level contains shared server settings and named proxies. **Codex and
Claude each have their own `auth_file`, `base_url`, and `routing` settings**:

```yaml
listen_port: 8787
request_timeout_seconds: 300

proxies:
  us: "http://127.0.0.1:7891"
  claude_official: "http://127.0.0.1:7893"

codex:
  base_url:
    account: "https://chatgpt.com/backend-api"
  auth_file: "~/.codex/auth.json"
  account_auth_file_only: true
  routing:
    account:
      default: us
    # api_key:
    #   OPENAI_API_KEY: us

claude:
  base_url: "https://api.anthropic.com"
  auth_file: "~/.claude/.credentials.json"
  account_auth_file_only: true
  routing:
    account:
      default: claude_official
    # api_key:
    #   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: claude_official
```

Either service section can be omitted. Within each section:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `base_url` | Claude: one upstream root for both OAuth and API Keys |
| `base_url.account` | Codex: ChatGPT account upstream |
| `base_url.api_key` | Codex: API Key upstream; defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `auth_file` | Saved account credential file |
| `auth_env` | Alternative: environment variable containing the account access token |
| `routing.account.<label>` | Proxy choice for that account source |
| `routing.api_key.<selector>` | Proxy choice for an API Key environment variable (Codex also accepts provider IDs) |
| `routing.account_fallback` | Proxy choice for an account without an explicit mapping |
| `routing.api_key_fallback` | Proxy choice for an unmatched API Key credential |

Place `auth_file` directly under `codex` or `claude`; the saved login is named
`default` in `routing.account`. `auth_env` is an alternative environment variable
source and cannot be combined with `auth_file`. Files are read per request, so
credential rotation takes effect without restarting. The clients handle login
and token refresh; keychain-only credentials are not read by this service.

Only configure `routing.api_key` when needed. Migration omits empty API Key maps
and unused default Codex API Key base URLs. Existing configured API Key routes
are retained. Older nested `accounts` remain readable for compatibility; do not
mix them with direct `auth_file`/`auth_env`. Multiple or ambiguous legacy named
sources remain nested when flattening would alter routing.

### Service-specific matching

Codex account routing tries account ID, then email/preferred username/name from
the login tokens, then the matched source label, then `codex.routing.account_fallback`.
A supplied `ChatGPT-Account-Id` must match the token's actual account ID.
Access-token profile metadata takes precedence over top-level claims and ID-token
metadata. These are routing hints; upstream authentication still validates tokens.

Both services support `account_auth_file_only`, defaulting to `true`:

| Mode | Codex | Claude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `true` | Require a configured saved token and read its account claims | Require a configured saved token and read the local CLI account metadata |
| `false` | Also accept other ChatGPT tokens using their JWT claims | Also accept other OAuth tokens after a successful profile lookup |

For Claude's standard `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, account metadata comes from
`~/.claude.json` → `oauthAccount`. Custom credential directories use their own
`.claude.json`; they do not inherit another login's home metadata. UUID, email,
display name, and full name are matched in that order, followed by the source
label (`default` for flat `auth_file`) and `claude.routing.account_fallback`.
Metadata refreshes per request. Missing/malformed metadata leaves explicit source
label and fallback routing available. An environment-backed account source has
no associated metadata file and uses its configured label/fallback.

In `true` mode, even an explicit account fallback cannot admit an unmatched token.
In `false` mode, `auth_file` may be omitted or unavailable and `--check` skips saved
account requirements, just as for Codex. Matched local tokens still use local
metadata; it is never reused for a different incoming token.

Claude tokens are opaque, so an unknown token requires `GET /api/oauth/profile`
on `claude.base_url`. Before identity is known, **`claude.routing.account_fallback`
provides the lookup proxy** (including ordered candidates). It must be explicitly
configured; no implicit direct route or another account's proxy is used. Only the
Bearer token and profile-request headers are sent, without model payload, cookies
or client headers. The account returned by the API selects the final UUID/email
route for the model request. Example:

```yaml
claude:
  base_url: "https://api.anthropic.com"
  account_auth_file_only: false
  routing:
    account:
      "you@example.com": claude_official
    account_fallback: claude_official
```

Successful profile identities are cached in memory per token for 5 minutes, up
to 128 entries. Tokens without profile permission, rejected tokens, malformed
profiles and transport failures do not forward the model payload and are not
cached. Lookup redirects are not followed. Lookup errors never trigger a direct
retry. Profiles are limited to 64 KiB and lookup time to 10 seconds or the configured
request timeout, whichever is lower. API Key routes are unaffected by this flag.
Missing authentication never activates any fallback.

Codex API Key URL selectors match explicit upstream requests (see below).
Other selectors first match Codex provider IDs; otherwise they are treated
as environment variable names and may reverse-match a provider by `env_key`.
Multiple reverse matches are rejected. The built-in `openai` provider and unmatched
variables use `codex.base_url.api_key`; custom providers use the `base_url` in
Codex's `config.toml`, including supported explicit local wrapper URLs.
Claude API Key selectors can be environment variable names (using `claude.base_url`)
or explicit HTTPS upstream bases, as described below. Matched API credentials
may use Bearer or `x-api-key`; they do not trigger OAuth profile lookup or receive
injected OAuth beta flags. Requests matching multiple credentials in a
namespace are rejected. The two services never use each other's fallbacks.

Codex alone supports `codex.routing.mcp_fallback` for public OpenAI documentation
MCP. Omitted/null/`none` means direct MCP access. Explicit matched routes take
priority. Account/API fallbacks default to rejection when omitted/null.

### Upstreams, proxies and ordered candidates

Default upstreams must be HTTPS public hostnames; explicitly declared third-party
Claude API routes may also use public IPv4 addresses. Codex's account base is the ChatGPT
backend root: model requests use `/codex`, usage uses `/wham`, and plugin APIs use
`/ps`. A legacy `/backend-api/codex` base is normalized to `/backend-api`.
Claude's single base URL is a root **without `/v1`**: native `/v1` and
`/api/oauth` paths are preserved. The Claude base may point to a compatible
Anthropic gateway; no model or protocol conversion is performed.

`proxies` defines named HTTP CONNECT, HTTPS CONNECT or SOCKS5 endpoints. URLs
require explicit ports. Reserved `none` selects direct access; a proxy alias may
also map to `none`. Transport clients disable inherited/system proxy discovery:
all outbound selection happens in this service, independently of client proxy
environment variables.

Every routing value accepts a proxy name, `none`, or an ordered list.
Proxy candidate lists are always written inline, for example `[jp_lab, jp]`;
migration preserves their order and avoids multiline lists:

```yaml
codex:
  routing:
    api_key:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: [us, jp]
    api_key_fallback: [us, jp, none]
    mcp_fallback: [jp, none]
claude:
  routing:
    api_key:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: claude_official
```

Merge those entries into the appropriate service sections, with proxy names
defined under `proxies`. Scalar routes send directly through the selected proxy.
Lists probe candidates sequentially with unauthenticated `HEAD /` requests to
the actual upstream HTTPS origin, without model tokens, account headers, bodies
or query parameters. HTTP 200–499 other than 407 establishes reachability;
redirects are not followed. Each probe is limited to 5 seconds or the request
timeout, whichever is lower. Selection repeats per request. Empty lists and
unknown names are rejected at startup. All failed candidates return 502.
The payload is sent once; API/streaming failures never replay it on another proxy.

YAML is loaded at startup. Restart after changing routes, upstreams, proxies or
timeouts. Codex provider metadata and account credential files refresh per request.
Environment-backed credentials use process variables first. On macOS/Linux, an
absent variable is read from the user's login/interactive zsh, bash or sh, with a
3-second timeout and no logged values. Windows uses process variables only.
Shell startup must not require terminal interaction. Saved Codex account matches
do not launch a shell to resolve unrelated API Key providers.

```sh
target/release/coding-agent-proxy --config config.yaml --check
target/release/coding-agent-proxy --config config.yaml
```

`--check` validates configuration and enabled credential sources, not network
reachability. Stop with Ctrl-C or SIGTERM.

### Migrate older configurations

Older top-level Codex `auth_file`, `account_auth_file_only`, `base_url` and `routing`
are still accepted, along with the earlier legacy upstream/provider fields.
Old Claude inline `accounts.<label>.proxy`, `api_key` and fallback fields are also
accepted. A legacy split Claude base URL is accepted only when both URLs agree. Do not mix `codex` with top-level Codex fields,
or Claude's new `routing` with its old inline routing fields: ambiguous settings
are rejected, including explicit null legacy keys.

The migration command writes the symmetric layout to a private file:

```sh
target/release/coding-agent-proxy --config config.yaml --write-config config.new.yaml
target/release/coding-agent-proxy --config config.new.yaml --check
```

It flattens single saved-login files into each service section, preserves ID/email
routing and proxy choices, and writes one Claude base URL. Claude source labels
become `default` when flattened. Empty API Key maps are omitted. Both formats behave the same
after migration. Legacy API Key entries with per-route upstream overrides, key
files or unrepresentable duplicate selectors are refused instead of silently
losing settings. Back up the active configuration before replacing it, then restart.

## Connect Codex

Top-level Codex settings (before any TOML table):

```toml
openai_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:7889/v1"
chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:7889/backend-api"
```

The first setting controls model requests; the second independently controls
ChatGPT backend requests. Codex only adds `/backend-api` automatically for
recognized official hostnames, so include it for a loopback URL. Restart Codex
after editing. The service uses HTTP/SSE; WebSocket upgrades are unsupported.

For matched ChatGPT credentials, `/responses`, `/v1/responses` and
`/backend-api/codex/responses` map to the same model endpoint. Official
`/backend-api/...` paths retain their full path, including plugin listing at
`/backend-api/ps/plugins/installed` and analytics events. The usage endpoints
`/backend-api/wham/usage` and `/backend-api/wham/rate-limit-reset-credits` require
GET and a matched ChatGPT login; API Keys cannot read subscription limits.

The explicit upstream URL form also works, for example:
`http://127.0.0.1:7889/https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` or
`http://127.0.0.1:7889/https://provider.example.com/v1/responses`.
The HTTPS origin and API path must match the credential's configured upstream.
There is no arbitrary unauthenticated URL forwarding or `?base_url=` parameter.

### Codex API URL routes

`codex.routing.api_key` accepts upstream URLs as well as provider IDs and
environment variables:

```yaml
codex:
  routing:
    api_key:
      "provider.example.com/v1": [jp, us]
      "https://182.92.106.196:6060": none
```

Set the Codex client base URL to
`http://127.0.0.1:8787/codex/https://provider.example.com/v1`.
URL routes require a Bearer token, which the upstream validates; they do not
require a local provider credential source or a fallback. They preserve request
paths, queries, bodies and streaming responses. `--check` and migration recognize
URL selectors without looking them up as environment variables.

In routing keys, both `https://` and the API path may be omitted. A key such as
`api.example.com` defaults to HTTPS and matches every path on that origin;
`api.example.com/v1` is more specific and wins for `/v1` and `/v1/...`, but not
`/v1-other`. The longest matching path wins and the request path is not rewritten.
Ports still match exactly (omitted means 443). `//api.example.com/v1` is also
accepted. Equivalent spellings cannot be configured twice. Keys containing a
dot, colon or slash are interpreted as URL selectors; plain provider IDs and
environment-variable names remain credential selectors. Client base URLs still
use the explicit `http://127.0.0.1:8787/.../https://...` form.

Codex and Claude share the same origin/path matcher, public-IP validation, ordered
proxy selection and verified TLS transport for explicit URL routes. If both apps
configure matching URL routes, an unprefixed `/https://...` request returns 409;
use `/codex/https://...` or `/anthropic/https://...` to select the application.
A URL declared for only one app also works with the unprefixed form.

### OpenAI documentation MCP

```toml
[mcp_servers.openaiDeveloperDocs]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:7889/mcp/openaiDeveloperDocs"
enabled = true
```

No helper or per-session configuration is required. The destination is fixed to
`https://developers.openai.com/mcp`. A matching optional Bearer credential selects
the same route as model requests. Otherwise `codex.routing.mcp_fallback` applies;
with the URL-only configuration above, requests normally use that fallback.
Model tokens, account IDs, cookies and other private headers are not sent to the
public MCP upstream. MCP session/protocol headers, JSON and SSE are preserved.

## Connect Claude Code / Anthropic

Configure `claude.auth_file` and `claude.routing` as shown above, then set this
persistent environment entry in Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json` (merge
with existing settings):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8787/anthropic"
  }
}
```

Use your configured `listen_port`. Start `claude` normally. Outbound proxies
belong in this service's YAML; no proxy environment variables are needed in the
Claude configuration. For a one-time invocation:

```sh
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787/anthropic claude
```

The `/anthropic` prefix is removed before forwarding (`/claude` remains an alias).
Messages, token counting, model listing and other native API paths retain `/v1`
and query strings. Unprefixed `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/...`, and `/api/oauth/...`
also select Claude. Use `/anthropic/v1/models` for the ambiguous models path.
Explicit URLs must match either a declared API URL route or the default
`claude.base_url` origin and base path. See third-party routing below.

API credentials preserve the incoming `x-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer ...`
header; subscription credentials use Bearer authentication. Requests containing both are rejected. Client
`anthropic-version`, beta flags, user agent, JSON and SSE are preserved.
Missing `anthropic-version` defaults to `2023-06-01`; OAuth account requests merge
`oauth-2025-04-20` into existing beta flags. Cookies, proxy credentials and
ChatGPT account headers are removed. Upstream errors and rate-limit headers pass
through unchanged. `GET /anthropic/api/oauth/usage` requires a matched local OAuth account or an
account identified by the profile API in `false` mode. API Keys cannot use it.

Claude Code remains responsible for login and token refresh. The proxy reads
credentials without changing them; it does not implement login, token refresh,
macOS Keychain discovery, or OpenAI-to-Anthropic conversion. A keychain-only login
needs an explicit environment-backed credential or an account fallback.
OAuth clients must still satisfy Anthropic's upstream client requirements.

client, and Sub2api's [Anthropic forwarding](https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api/blob/main/backend/internal/service/gateway_anthropic_passthrough.go)
and [Claude header definitions](https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api/blob/main/backend/internal/pkg/claude/constants.go).

### Third-party Claude APIs

A custom shell command or `claude --settings <file>` may load settings from any
path. This service does not assume a `profiles` directory and does not infer a
settings filename from an opaque token. Declare the third-party upstream directly:

```yaml
claude:
  base_url: "https://api.anthropic.com"
  auth_file: "~/.claude/.credentials.json"
  account_auth_file_only: true
  routing:
    account:
      "you@example.com": claude_official
    api_key:
      "https://182.92.106.196:6060": none
```

Point the third-party client's `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/https://182.92.106.196:6060
```

`/anthropic/https://...` is also supported. The local listener uses **HTTP**;
the embedded upstream uses **HTTPS**. The URL route applies to Messages, token
counting, model discovery, and other paths under that configured base. The
longest matching base path wins; scheme, host, port and path boundaries must
match. Undeclared destinations cannot use another route. A configured public
IPv4 upstream is supported; private, loopback and link-local IPs are rejected.

These routes require one nonempty `Authorization: Bearer ...` or `x-api-key`
header. They select the proxy by the declared upstream; the upstream validates
the forwarded API credential. They are independent of `account_auth_file_only`
and require no account/API fallback. `none` explicitly selects direct access.
Requests and SSE pass through unchanged, with no OAuth conversion or model
rewriting. Environment-variable API selectors continue to match credentials
locally. Explicit URL routes need no token in this service's configuration.

A custom CA supplied to the Claude client does not automatically become trusted
by the proxy. Explicit API routes use native TLS for compatibility with Node/OpenSSL;
Credential-based Codex routes and default Claude routes retain rustls. Both verify certificates and
hostname/IP identity. On Linux, supply a self-signed API certificate through the
service's `SSL_CERT_FILE` CA bundle (include the system CAs), and restart. Other
platforms use their native certificate stores. Linux builds vendor OpenSSL and
require a C toolchain, make and Perl; no system libssl runtime is needed. No settings-directory discovery or disabled TLS verification is needed.

## Run as a background service

Build the Rust release executable, prepare `config.yaml`, and run:

```sh
python3 scripts/service_rust.py install
python3 scripts/service_rust.py status
```

Use `python` instead of `python3` on Windows if needed. The installer copies the
executable and initial configuration into a per-user runtime directory. It runs
the native executable directly, without a Python supervisor:

| Platform | Background runner | Runtime directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | launchd user agent | `~/Library/Application Support/coding-agent-proxy-rust` |
| Linux | systemd user service | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/coding-agent-proxy-rust`, default `~/.local/share/coding-agent-proxy-rust` |
| Windows | Task Scheduler task at user logon | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/coding-agent-proxy-rust` |

The Windows task runs in the logged-in user's session; it is not a system service
that runs before login. Linux requires an available systemd user manager. On all
platforms, manage mihomo/Clash separately; the Rust service manager does not start
an external proxy core. The complete Linux service lifecycle has been verified
on Ubuntu 20.04 with systemd 245. Windows task registration still needs native
verification.

The service/task name is `local.coding-agent-proxy.rust`. Stop any existing
listener on the configured port before installing. The script manages only its
own service registration and runtime directory.
Use `--binary /path/to/executable` and `--config /path/to/config.yaml` to install
from other locations.

Edit the runtime copy of `config.yaml`, then restart to apply changes. Updates
preserve that copy. Absolute credential paths are recommended. Linux services can
load exported API Keys and `CODEX_HOME` from a private `service.env` file beside
that runtime config, using systemd EnvironmentFile syntax. Windows API Keys must
be available in the scheduled task's process environment.

```sh
cargo build --locked --release
python3 scripts/service_rust.py update
python3 scripts/service_rust.py restart
```

On Windows, run `stop` before `update` because Windows locks running executables,
then run `restart`. On Unix, `update` stages the new executable without restarting.
`stop`, `status`, `restart`, and `uninstall` operate only on the Rust registration.
`uninstall` retains configuration and logs. Logs are under `logs/proxy.log` in the
runtime directory. Restart briefly interrupts active requests.

```sh
curl --noproxy '*' http://127.0.0.1:7889/health
```

Health confirms that the listener is running, not upstream connectivity.

## Proxy username/password authentication

Proxy entries retain their string format and may include credentials:

```yaml
proxies:
  authenticated_http: "http://proxy-user:proxy-password@proxy.example.com:8080"
  authenticated_https: "https://proxy-user:proxy-password@proxy.example.com:8443"
  authenticated_socks: "socks5://proxy-user:proxy-password@proxy.example.com:1080"
```

The Rust HTTP transport supplies the credentials to the proxy, separately
from the model request's Bearer token. Percent-encode reserved characters in
usernames/passwords: for example, `user@example` and `p:ss@word` become
`user%40example:p%3Ass%40word`. Supply both fields; an empty password is accepted
for HTTP(S), while SOCKS5 requires 1–255 UTF-8 bytes per field. HTTP usernames
cannot contain a colon. Credentials containing control characters are rejected.

Proxy endpoint logs omit both username and password. Unauthenticated URLs and
`none` remain supported. Restart the service after changing proxy credentials
in YAML. An authentication failure does not switch to a different proxy or direct
access.

## Multiple proxy services with mihomo and Clash

[mihomo](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo) is the proxy core used by compatible Clash clients. One core can expose several local proxy services at once, each pinned to a different outbound node. For example:

| Account mapping | Local endpoint | Fixed outbound node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `us` | `127.0.0.1:8101` | `US-Node` |
| `jp` | `127.0.0.1:8102` | `JP-Node` |

Use a Clash client with a **mihomo-compatible core**. Older Clash cores may not support custom `listeners`. System Proxy and TUN mode are not required for these explicit local connections.

### 1. Add dedicated listeners

Add the following to your mihomo configuration, or use your Clash client's persistent profile override/merge mechanism. If a `listeners` list already exists, append these entries instead of creating a duplicate YAML key. Replace `US-Node` and `JP-Node` with exact names of nodes available in the active configuration.

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: coding-us
    type: mixed
    listen: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8101
    udp: false
    users: []
    proxy: US-Node

  - name: coding-jp
    type: mixed
    listen: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8102
    udp: false
    users: []
    proxy: JP-Node
```

Each `mixed` listener accepts HTTP CONNECT and SOCKS5. Its `proxy` field sends traffic directly to the named outbound node. Using a concrete node keeps the route independent of changes to a shared selector group. If you deliberately use a proxy group instead, its selection and fallback policy determine the actual exit; keep it restricted to the intended region and exclude `DIRECT` when direct access must be prevented.

`users: []` disables inbound authentication for these loopback listeners, for the unauthenticated local proxy URLs in these examples. Authentication to a remote proxy can still be handled by mihomo itself.

### 2. Configure the outbound nodes

If your Clash profile already supplies the nodes, keep its existing definitions and use their exact names above. If your provider supplies authenticated HTTPS CONNECT proxies, the following illustrates the equivalent mihomo `proxies` entries:

```yaml
proxies:
  - name: US-Node
    type: http
    server: us-proxy.example.com
    port: 443
    username: REPLACE_WITH_US_USERNAME
    password: REPLACE_WITH_US_PASSWORD
    tls: true

  - name: JP-Node
    type: http
    server: jp-proxy.example.com
    port: 443
    username: REPLACE_WITH_JP_USERNAME
    password: REPLACE_WITH_JP_PASSWORD
    tls: true
```

These reserved example domains and credentials are placeholders, not working proxies. Use the protocol, port, TLS settings, and credentials required by your provider. Other mihomo-supported node types can be used behind the same listeners. Keep real node definitions and subscription URLs in your private mihomo/Clash configuration.

### 3. Load the configuration

**Clash client:** save the override, reload the profile or restart its core, and inspect the effective configuration to confirm both listeners are present. Exact menu names vary by client. Use persistent overrides because subscription refreshes can replace direct edits to a downloaded profile.

**Standalone mihomo on macOS:** install with Homebrew if needed:

```sh
brew install mihomo
```

The Homebrew configuration directory is usually `/opt/homebrew/etc/mihomo` on Apple Silicon or `/usr/local/etc/mihomo` on Intel. For a standalone configuration, combine the listener and node sections above with these top-level settings in a private `config.yaml`:

```yaml
allow-lan: false
bind-address: 127.0.0.1
mode: rule
log-level: info
rules:
  - MATCH,REJECT
```

The named listener routes select their configured nodes directly; the final rule rejects traffic that reaches ordinary rule routing. This rule is for the standalone example, not a replacement for an existing Clash profile's rules.

Validate and run your configuration, replacing the directory with its actual location:

```sh
mihomo -t -d /path/to/private/mihomo -f /path/to/private/mihomo/config.yaml
mihomo -d /path/to/private/mihomo -f /path/to/private/mihomo/config.yaml
```

If Homebrew manages the configuration at its default location, you can run it as a service instead:

```sh
brew services start mihomo
# After editing the configuration of an existing service:
brew services restart mihomo
```

Choose either a Clash-managed core or a standalone core for these ports. Do not start two processes listening on the same addresses and ports.

### 4. Verify each exit and connect the application

Test each listener independently:

```sh
curl --noproxy '' --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8101 --max-time 20 https://api.ipify.org
curl --noproxy '' --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:8102 --max-time 20 https://api.ipify.org
```

These commands contact an external IP-check service through the selected node. Compare the results with your provider's expected exits; an IP response alone does not establish a country or guarantee access to the Codex upstream. `socks5h` is curl's remote-DNS option; use `socks5://` in this application's YAML.

The `proxies` entries in the quick-start configuration already match these listener ports. Add the real account mappings, run `--check`, start the application, and inspect `route_selected` events to confirm the account and local endpoint selected for each request.

For another region, add a node, give it a listener on a unique port, and add the corresponding application proxy label and account mapping.

## Logs

Logs are written to stderr and to `logs/proxy.log` beside the application configuration file. Override the file location with `--log-file /path/to/proxy.log`.

```sh
tail -F logs/proxy.log
```

Each line is JSON with a UTC timestamp. Log files rotate at 5 MiB and retain one backup as `proxy.log.1`. Unix files use mode `0600`; Windows files inherit directory ACLs, so keep them in your private user directory. If file logging fails, the service reports it on stderr and continues console logging.

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `current_route` | Account ID and proxy configured at startup; not a connectivity test. |
| `route_unavailable` | Startup credentials or mapping could not be read; later requests retry credential loading using the startup configuration. |
| `request_received` | Request method, path without query, and unique request ID. |
| `route_selected` | Account and proxy actually selected for this request. |
| `upstream_response` | Upstream HTTP status and time to response headers (`headers_ms`). |
| `request_finished` | Transfer completed, including status, duration, and received bytes; check status for upstream errors. |
| `request_rejected` / `request_failed` | Authentication, configuration, connection, or streaming failure with diagnostic context. |

Logs contain **full account IDs and proxy endpoints**. They do not record tokens, authentication headers, query parameters, or request/response bodies. Keep logs private. `/health` requests are excluded from request logs.

## Limits and troubleshooting

- Default upstreams require HTTPS and a public service hostname. Explicit Claude API URL routes also accept public IPv4 addresses; private addresses and local hostnames remain rejected.
- Proxy URLs require an explicit port and support `http`, `https`, or `socks5`. Optional username/password authentication uses `scheme://username:password@host:port`. Credentials are removed from logged proxy URLs.
- Inbound limits: 32 MiB request body, 64 KiB headers, 128 concurrent connections, and a 30-second read timeout. Content-Length and chunked uploads are supported; each connection handles one request.
- `Expect: 100-continue` returns HTTP 417. WebSocket Upgrade returns HTTP 426.
- Upstream response chunks, including SSE, are forwarded as they arrive with backpressure. There is no whole-response buffering or automatic decompression. Content-Encoding is preserved when returned by an upstream.
- `request_timeout_seconds` accepts 1–3600 seconds and configures both the upstream request timeout and the total resource timeout. A failure after streaming starts closes the connection without inserting a JSON error into the stream.
- Local HTTP 401 means the Bearer token is missing/malformed, or no credential matches and OpenAI fallback is disabled. HTTP 409 means the account header does not match or the token matches multiple routes. HTTP 502 indicates a routing/configuration or upstream connection failure. Upstream HTTP errors retain their original status and body.
- If a mihomo listener refuses connections, confirm the effective profile contains it, its node name is valid, and the port is not occupied. If the exit changes unexpectedly, inspect the listener's node/group selection.
- After rebuilding a running service, restart that process to use the new executable.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
cargo build --locked
python3 scripts/integration.py
python3 scripts/test_proxy_auth.py
python3 scripts/test_service_rust.py
```

Tests use synthetic credentials and loopback sockets. Rust tests cover TLS and
HTTP/HTTPS CONNECT, early SSE delivery, proxy selection, request framing, and
MCP credential isolation. Python integration tests cover account/API Key routing,
credential refresh, configuration snapshots, migration, fallback refusal and
HTTP/SOCKS5 authentication. They do not call a real model. CI runs these checks
and builds release binaries for all three operating systems.

On Linux with a working systemd user session, also run:

```sh
cargo build --locked --release
python3 scripts/test_systemd.py
```

This test uses a temporary runtime directory, a unique service name, and an
ephemeral loopback port. It verifies installation, configuration-preserving
updates, restart, stop, and uninstall without changing the normal service.

The Python transport tests default to `target/debug/coding-agent-proxy` (with
`.exe` on Windows). Set `CODING_AGENT_PROXY_BINARY` to test another build, such as
the release executable.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **[Copool](https://github.com/AlickH/Copool)** and its contributors. Copool's local proxy implementation informed this project's design. This implementation uses Tokio, Hyper, reqwest and rustls. This project's HTTP parsing and account routing are implemented separately; it does not include Copool's account pool, account rotation, quota management, model mapping, or protocol conversion features.

Thanks also to [mihomo](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo) for the proxy core used in the multi-listener setup.
